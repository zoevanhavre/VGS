<h2>The Washing Machine!</h2>

<h3>$300</h3>

<p><strong>Fisher &amp; Paykel</strong> front loader, 1 year old.</p>

<p>Works perfectly, very low water and power consumption.</p>

<p>Settings for heavy duty + delicate, and for extra water savings. Easy to set timer to run at night. Digitally balanced, not a heavy machine and can be moved relatively easily, while being full sized.</p>
