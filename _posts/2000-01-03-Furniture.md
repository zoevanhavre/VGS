## Chest of drawers $150

These are top notch, with a lot of room inside, and all the drawers slide very smoothly. Perfect for clothes, even better for kids clothes with the nice star handles. It is even shinier than in the photo as I have now removed all traces of stickers from the handle (my sister had decorated it ^^)
