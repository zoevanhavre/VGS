# Big ticket items

These must go! But are quite good things.  As we need them until we move out, items here are **available ON the 1st/2nd of July** (this is a saturday/sunday).




## The Fridge!

### $400

**Fisher & Paykel**

"Bottom freezer" fridge.

Approx 5 years old, in great condition (it was my parents, and has been mine for 2 years).

Chrome finish, double vege/fruit drawers, ample door shelving space.



####  available ON the 2nd/3rd of July

## The Washing Machine!

### $250

**Fisher & Paykel** front loader, 1 year old.

Works perfectly, very low water and power consumption.

Settings for heavy duty + delicate stuff, settings for extra water savings, and easy to set timer to run at night. Digitally balanced, not a heavy machine and can be moved relatively easily, while being full sized. 

####  available ON the 2nd/3rd of July
