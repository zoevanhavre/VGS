## The Fridge!

### $500 (worth ~$1500)

Approx 5 years old, in great condition (it was my parents, and has been mine for 2 years).

## The Washing Machine!

### $300

**Fisher & Paykel** front loader, 1 year old.

Works perfectly, very low water and power consumption.

Settings for heavy duty + delicate, and for extra water savings. Easy to set timer to run at night. Digitally balanced, not a heavy machine and can be moved relatively easily, while being full sized.
